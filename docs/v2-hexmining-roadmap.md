# V2 HexMining Roadmap

> **AI USAGE NOTE:** This is the condensed active working document (~200 lines). Full historical context, completed-phase details, PR logs, validation history, and research records are in [`docs/v2-hexmining-roadmap-archive.md`](./v2-hexmining-roadmap-archive.md). **For routine implementation work, read only this file.** Use `grep` to locate specific gates or sections. Do not load the archive into context unless explicitly asked.

**Document status:** Phase 4C internal pipeline complete and gated — PRs #208–#237 merged. Public estimated yield remains intentionally gated. `HexStakeYieldDto` contract APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION (§11.16, OQ-1–OQ-6 resolved, PR #232); reader assembly, route dependency wiring, focused public DTO contract coverage, and route/DTO closure documentation are closed by PRs #234–#237. Remaining gate-lift gates are still explicit in §11.14.

## Core Guardrails

These rules apply to every PR. See archive §3 and §11.6 for full rationale.

- **No frontend calculation.** Yield, PnL, valuation, and stake value are backend-only. Frontend consumes backend DTOs.
- **No frontend RPC.** `dailyDataRange`, `globalInfo`, `currentDay`, `stakeCount`, `stakeLists` are backend ingestion only.
- **No DexScreener.** Use on-chain PulseChain reserve-derived pricing only.
- **No symbol-only identity.** Always use `chain:369:erc20:0x...` (`assetId` format).
- **No zero coercion.** Missing, stale, or unavailable values must remain explicit with provenance and warnings.
- **No mock production data** in DTOs or frontend.
- **No pricing/PnL until Phase 7.** `valuation.status` and `pnl.status` remain `"unsupported"` until Phase 7 prerequisites are met.
- **No HSI/HTT, ended stakes, or Ethereum eHEX** until their respective phases.
- **No `canonicalPayload` exposure** in any DTO or API response.
- **Raw audit records are immutable.** Mark reorgs as REORGED — never delete or overwrite.

## Gate-Lift State (§11.14)

**Current public behavior:** `estimateHexMiningYield` still returns `status: "evidence_available"`, `yieldHex: null` for valid evidence paths. The formula runs internally (proven via injectable `applyCalculation` in tests) but the real production estimator does not yet surface non-null public estimated yield. Reader/route infrastructure can now carry an injected estimate result through the approved DTO path (PRs #234–#235), and PR #236 covers that path with focused contract tests; this is infrastructure/test closure, not public release of estimated yield.

See archive §11.14 for full gating rationale, internal behavior details, and review comment policy.

### Gate-protected implementation state

| File | Current constraint/status |
|---|---|
| `src/services/hexmining/yield-estimator.ts` | Public estimator gate remains active: valid evidence paths return `status: "evidence_available"`, `yieldHex: null`; no production promotion to `"estimated"` yet |
| `src/services/hexmining/reader.ts` | ✅ PR #234 closed reader assembly: injectable `estimateYield` results can assemble the approved `HexStakeYieldDto` shape; without the dep, yield remains `"unsupported"` |
| `app/api/hexmining/stakes/route.ts` | ✅ PR #235 closed route wiring: the route passes `estimateYield` into `readNativeHexStakes` using the existing `estimateHexMiningYield` + evidence-provider dependency path |
| `src/services/hexmining/observation-evidence-provider.ts` | Evidence provider remains backend-only; no canonical payload exposure in public DTO/API response |
| `tests/services/hexmining/reader.test.ts` | ✅ Reader contract coverage includes estimated DTO assembly and safety downgrades |
| `tests/api/hexmining-stakes-route-contract.test.ts` | ✅ PR #236 closed focused route/public DTO contract coverage for the injected estimated-yield path and route envelope |

### Gate-lift prerequisites

A gate-lift PR may promote `"estimated"` into public output **only** when all of the following are satisfied before release:

1. **Elapsed-days-only coverage rule** — ✅ **RESOLVED (PR #225)**
2. **BPD attribution gate** — ✅ **RESOLVED at estimator boundary (PR #226)**; reader/route `bpdYieldHex`/`bpdYieldStatus` assembly and contract coverage closed by PRs #234–#236; final production promotion remains gated
3. **§11.9 provenance fields** — ✅ **RESOLVED (PR #227)**
4. **`HexStakeDto.yield` field assembly** — ✅ **RESOLVED (PR #234)** — including `bpdYieldHex`, `bpdYieldStatus`, `estimatedYieldHex`, `provenance`, and `warnings` wiring from injected `estimateYield` results
5. **`GET /api/hexmining/stakes` route dependency wiring** — ✅ **RESOLVED (PR #235)** — route passes `estimateYield` into `readNativeHexStakes` through the existing `estimateHexMiningYield` + `getObservationEvidenceWithPayloadForRange` path
6. **Contract tests for full public estimated-yield DTO path** — ✅ **RESOLVED (PR #236)** — covers non-null `estimatedYieldHex`, BPD field correlation/statuses, provenance completeness, missing-provenance downgrade, and route envelope
7. **EES/penalty distribution** — ✅ **RESOLVED (PR #224, Finding A)** — penalties already included in `dayPayoutTotal`; see `docs/hexmining-penalty-distribution-research.md`
8. **DTO contract approval** — ✅ **RESOLVED (PR #232)** — §11.16 OQ-1–OQ-6 approved
9. **Explicit contract tests for public estimated-yield DTO path** — ✅ **RESOLVED (PR #236)** — focused route/reader contract tests cover the approved DTO path before public promotion
10. Live-data fixture or opt-in integration verification against a known historical day range on PulseChain (chain ID 369) — 🔲 **OPEN**; execute according to [`docs/hexmining-live-data-verification-plan.md`](./hexmining-live-data-verification-plan.md) before any public estimated-yield promotion
11. Final docs record approving the gate lift — 🔲 **OPEN**; this roadmap must be updated with gate-lifted evidence and PR reference only after item 10 passes

**Resolved:** items 1–9, with item 2 resolved at the estimator boundary and reader/route coverage closed by PRs #234–#236. **Remaining gates before public estimated yield release:** item 10, item 11, and the final production promotion of valid evidence paths from internal `"evidence_available"`/`yieldHex: null` to public `"estimated"` with non-null `estimatedYieldHex`.

## Approved Public DTO Contract (§11.16)

**Approved in PR #232.** OQ-1–OQ-6 resolved. See archive §11.16 for full prose and original open-question history.

### TypeScript shape

```typescript
// Discriminated union on `status`
export type HexStakeYieldDto =
  | UnsupportedYieldDto
  | UnavailableYieldDto
  | EstimatedYieldDto;

export interface UnsupportedYieldDto {
  status: "unsupported";
  estimatedYieldHex: null;
  bpdYieldStatus: null;
  bpdYieldHex: null;
  provenance: null;
  warnings: string[];
}

export interface UnavailableYieldDto {
  status: "unavailable";
  estimatedYieldHex: null;
  bpdYieldStatus: "applicable" | "not_applicable" | "unknown";
  bpdYieldHex: null;
  provenance: HexStakeYieldProvenance | null;
  warnings: string[];
}

export type EstimatedYieldDto = {
  status: "estimated";
  estimatedYieldHex: string;            // bigint decimal string, unit: hearts
  provenance: HexStakeYieldProvenance;  // required when estimated
  warnings: string[];
} & (
  | { bpdYieldStatus: "applicable"; bpdYieldHex: string }
  | { bpdYieldStatus: "not_applicable" | "unknown"; bpdYieldHex: null }
);

export interface HexStakeYieldProvenance {
  chainId: number;       // always 369 (PulseChain)
  sourceFamily: string;  // always "HEXMINING"
  observationId: string; // UUID of the HexMiningObservation record used
  rangeStartDay: number; // inclusive start of observation day range
  rangeEndDay: number;   // inclusive end of observation day range (= elapsedEndDay)
}
```

### Field contract

**`status`** — discriminant

| Value | Public | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `"unsupported"` | Yes | Gate not lifted or chain unsupported |
| `"unavailable"` | Yes | Evidence fetch failed or insufficient observations |
| `"estimated"` | Yes | Gate-lift target — approved contract shape |
| `"exact"` | Yes | Reserved Phase 5+ |

**Internal statuses — must NEVER appear in any public DTO or API response:**

| Internal status | Maps to public | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `"evidence_available"` | `"unavailable"` | Formula ran internally; gate active; reader maps this (OQ-2) |
| `"insufficient_observations"` | `"unavailable"` | Evidence range does not cover elapsed period |
| `"invalid_observation"` | `"unavailable"` | Payload decode failure |

**`estimatedYieldHex`** — non-null only when `status: "estimated"`; hearts as bigint decimal string (OQ-1); cumulative yield via §8 formula (`Σ (stakeShares × dayPayoutTotal) / dayStakeSharesTotal`, bigint floor, multiply-first) over `[lockedDay, elapsedEndDay]` where `elapsedEndDay = min(currentDay − 1, lockedDay + stakedDays − 1)`; includes `dayPayoutTotal[353]` when elapsed range covers day 353; `bpdYieldHex` is a reporting split of this value, not additional.

**`bpdYieldStatus`** — null only when `status: "unsupported"`; `"applicable"` when stake was active on BPD day 353; `"not_applicable"` when stake did not span day 353 (`lockedDay > 353` or `lockedDay + stakedDays ≤ 353`); `"unknown"` when elapsed range includes day 353 but attribution unresolved (`hexmining-yield-bpd-attribution-unresolved` warning present).

**`bpdYieldHex`** — non-null ONLY when `bpdYieldStatus: "applicable"` AND `status: "estimated"`; hearts bigint decimal string; **portion of `estimatedYieldHex`** attributable to BPD day 353 — attribution/reporting split only (OQ-3). **Do NOT add `bpdYieldHex` to `estimatedYieldHex`** — `estimatedYieldHex` already includes day 353's payout.

**`provenance`** — non-null when `status: "estimated"`; fields match `HexMiningYieldEstimateProvenance` — `chainId` (always 369), `sourceFamily` (always `"HEXMINING"`), `observationId` (UUID to `HexMiningObservation` record), `rangeStartDay`, `rangeEndDay` (= `elapsedEndDay`) (OQ-4).

**`warnings`** — always present, never null; current codes pass through unchanged (OQ-5): `"hexmining-yield-bpd-attribution-unresolved"`, `"hexmining-yield-no-elapsed-days"`, `"hexmining-yield-insufficient-elapsed-day-coverage"`; future internal-only codes must be filtered at reader boundary.

**`schemaVersion`:** top-level `HexStakeDto.schemaVersion` bumped on gate lift — no separate yield subobject version (OQ-6).

**This contract is APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION.** Infrastructure and focused contract-test closure are complete through PR #236, with closure documentation recorded by PR #237. Remaining public-release gates: §11.14 items 10–11 plus the final production promotion from gated internal evidence to public `"estimated"`. Item 10 must follow the live-data/opt-in verification plan before any gate lift.

## Next PR

```
feat(hexmining): lift public estimated yield gate after live-data verification
```

**Prerequisites satisfied:** items 1–3 and 7–9 resolved; item 2 resolved at estimator boundary; reader assembly, route dependency wiring, focused public DTO contract coverage, and closure documentation closed by PRs #234–#237. **Remaining before public release:** item 10 live-data/opt-in verification using [`docs/hexmining-live-data-verification-plan.md`](./hexmining-live-data-verification-plan.md), item 11 final docs approval, and final production promotion from internal `"evidence_available"`/`yieldHex: null` to public `"estimated"` with non-null `estimatedYieldHex`.

**2026-06-12 closure note (PRs #235–#236):** PR #235 wires the `/api/hexmining/stakes` route to pass `estimateYield` into `readNativeHexStakes` through the existing `estimateHexMiningYield` dependency path. PR #236 adds focused contract coverage for estimated yield plus provenance, BPD `applicable`/`not_applicable`/`unknown`, missing-provenance downgrade, and the route response envelope. This records infrastructure/test closure only; public estimated yield remains gated until the remaining gates above are complete. These changes introduced no fabricated yield, no frontend truth, and no DTO weakening.

**Required in the gate-lift PR:**
- Follow the approved §11.16 contract above (field shapes, OQ-1–OQ-6 decisions, `evidence_available` → `"unavailable"` mapping until the final production promotion)
- Keep the PR production promotion narrow: change the real estimator path only after item 10 is satisfied so valid evidence can surface public `"estimated"` output
- Execute and record the live-data fixture or opt-in integration verification against a known historical day range on PulseChain exactly as scoped in [`docs/hexmining-live-data-verification-plan.md`](./hexmining-live-data-verification-plan.md)
- Final docs record approving gate lift (update this roadmap only after item 10 evidence passes)
- `valuation.status` and `pnl.status` remain `"unsupported"` — unchanged

**Not completed by the live-data verification-plan PR:**
- No live verification executed
- No production gate lifted
- No public estimated yield exposed
- No code changed

**Must NOT happen without a gate-lift implementation PR:**
- No change to steps 8–9 of `estimateHexMiningYield` to return `"estimated"` without all prerequisites
- No production promotion to public `"estimated"` without live-data/opt-in verification and final gate-lift docs
- No partial gate lift (e.g., surfacing `yieldHex` without provenance completeness)
- No frontend yield changes, React hooks, or TanStack Query hooks for yield until Step 4 is merged
- No `canonicalPayload` exposure in any DTO or API response
- No `valuation.status`/`pnl.status` changes (remain `"unsupported"` until Phase 7)
